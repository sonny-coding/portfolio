```jsx
// Fetching Data on the server
// Have direct access to backend data resources (e.g. databases).
// Keep your application more secure by preventing sensitive
// information, such as access tokens and API keys, from being
// exposed to the client.
// Fetch data and render in the same environment. This reduces
// both the back-and-forth communication between client and server,
// as well as the work on the main thread on the client.
// Perform multiple data fetches with single round-trip instead
// of multiple individual requests on the client.
// Reduce client-server waterfalls.
// Depending on your region, data fetching can also happen closer
// to your data source, reducing latency and improving performance.
```

```jsx
// Fetching Data at the Component level
// In the App Router, you can fetch data inside layouts,
// pages, and components.
// We recommend fetching data directly inside the layout
// that needs it, even if you're requesting the same data
// multiple times in a route. Behind the scenes, React and
// Next.js will cache and dedupe requests to avoid the
// same data being fetched more than once.
```

```jsx
// Parallel and Sequential Data Fetching
// When fetching data inside components, you need to be
// aware of two data fetching patterns: Parallel and Sequential.
// With parallel data fetching, requests in a route are
// eagerly initiated and will load data at the same time.
// This reduces client-server waterfalls and the total time
// it takes to load data.
// With sequential data fetching, requests in a route
// are dependent on each other and create waterfalls. There
// may be cases where you want this pattern because one
// fetch depends on the result of the other, or you want
// a condition to be satisfied before the next fetch to
// save resources. However, this behavior can also be
// unintentional and lead to longer loading times.
```

```jsx
// Automatic fetch() Request Deduping
// Next.js will automatically cache fetch requests (GET)
// that have the same input in a temporary cache. This
// optimization prevents the same data from being fetched
// more than once during a rendering pass.
// POST requests are not automatically deduplicated.
```

```jsx
// Static and Dynamic Data Fetching
// Static Data is data that doesn't change often.
// For example, a blog post.
// Dynamic Data is data that changes often or can
// be specific to users. For example, a shopping cart list.
// By default, Next.js automatically does static fetches.
// This means that the data will be fetched at build time,
// cached, and reused on each request
```

```jsx
// The Next.js App Router allows you to fetch data
// directly in your React components by marking the
// function as async and using await for the Promise
async function getData() {
  const res = await fetch("https://api.example.com/...");
  // The return value is *not* serialized
  // You can return Date, Map, Set, etc.

  // Recommendation: handle errors
  if (!res.ok) {
    // This will activate the closest `error.js` Error Boundary
    throw new Error("Failed to fetch data");
  }
  return res.json();
}
export default async function Page() {
  const data = await getData();
  return <main></main>;
}
```

```jsx
// use in Client Components
// Wrapping fetch in use is currently not recommended
// in Client Components and may trigger multiple re-renders.
// For now, if you need to fetch data in a Client Component,
//we recommend using a third-party library such as SWR or React Query
```

```jsx
// By default, fetch will automatically fetch and cache data indefinitely.
fetch("https://..."); // cache: 'force-cache' is the default
// To revalidate cached data at a timed interval, you can
// use the next.revalidate option in fetch() to set the
// cache lifetime of a resource (in seconds).
fetch("https://...", { next: { revalidate: 10 } });
// To fetch fresh data on every fetch request, use
// the cache: 'no-store' option.
fetch("https://...", { cache: "no-store" });
```

```jsx
// parallel data fetching
async function getArtist(username) {
  const res = await fetch(`https://api.example.com/artist/${username}`);
  return res.json();
}
async function getArtistAlbums(username) {
  const res = await fetch(`https://api.example.com/artist/${username}/albums`);
  return res.json();
}
export default async function Page({ params: { username } }) {
  // Initiate both requests in parallel
  const artistData = getArtist(username);
  const albumsData = getArtistAlbums(username);

  // Wait for the promises to resolve
  const [artist, albums] = await Promise.all([artistData, albumsData]);
  // more codes...
}
// By starting the fetch prior to calling await in the
// Server Component, each request can eagerly start to
// fetch requests at the same time. This sets the components
// up so you can avoid waterfalls.
// By starting the fetch prior to calling await in the
// Server Component, each request can eagerly start to fetch
// requests at the same time. This sets the components up so
// you can avoid waterfalls.
```

```jsx
// To improve the user experience, you can add a
// suspense boundary to break up the rendering work and
// show part of the result as soon as possible:
import { getArtist, getArtistAlbums } from "./api";

export default async function Page({ params: { username } }) {
  // Initiate both requests in parallel
  const artistData = getArtist(username);
  const albumData = getArtistAlbums(username);

  // Wait for the artist's promise to resolve first
  const artist = await artistData;

  return (
    <>
      <h1>{artist.name}</h1>
      {/* Send the artist information first,
      and wrap albums in a suspense boundary */}
      <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
        <Albums promise={albumData} />
      </Suspense>
    </>
  );
}

// Albums Component
async function Albums({ promise }) {
  // Wait for the albums promise to resolve
  const albums = await promise;

  return (
    <ul>
      {albums.map((album) => (
        <li key={album.id}>{album.name}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}
```

```jsx
// Sequential Data Fetching
// To fetch data sequentially, you can fetch directly
// inside the component that needs it, or you can await
// the result of fetch inside the component that needs it:
// ...

async function Playlists({ artistID }) {
  // Wait for the playlists
  const playlists = await getArtistPlaylists(artistID);

  return (
    <ul>
      {playlists.map((playlist) => (
        <li key={playlist.id}>{playlist.name}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}

export default async function Page({ params: { username } }) {
  // Wait for the artist
  const artist = await getArtist(username);

  return (
    <>
      <h1>{artist.name}</h1>
      <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
        <Playlists artistID={artist.id} />
      </Suspense>
    </>
  );
}
// By fetching data inside the component, each fetch
// request and nested segment in the route cannot start
// fetching data and rendering until the previous request
// or segment has completed.
```

```jsx
// blocking rendering in a route
// By fetching data in a layout, rendering for all
// route segments beneath it can only start once the
// data has finished loading.
// In the pages directory, pages using server-rendering
// would show the browser loading spinner until getServerSideProps
// had finished, then render the React component for that page.
// This can be described as "all or nothing" data fetching.
// Either you had the entire data for your page, or none.
// In the app directory, you have additional options to explore:
// First, you can use loading.js to show an instant loading
// state from the server while streaming in the result from
// your data fetching function.
// Second, you can move data fetching lower in the component
// tree to only block rendering for the parts of the page that need it.
// Whenever possible, it's best to fetch data in the segment
// that uses it. This also allows you to show a loading state
// for only the part of the page that is loading, and not the
// entire page.
```

```jsx
// By default, all fetch() requests are cached and deduplicated
// automatically. This means that if you make the same request
// twice, the second request will reuse the result from the first request.
async function getComments() {
  const res = await fetch("https://..."); // The result is cached
  return res.json();
}

// This function is called twice, but the result is only fetched once
const comments = await getComments(); // cache MISS

// The second call could be anywhere in your application
const comments = await getComments(); // cache HIT
// Requests are not cached if:
// Dynamic methods (next/headers, export const POST, or similar)
// are used and the fetch is a POST request (or uses Authorization
// or cookie headers)
// fetchCache is configured to skip cache by default
// revalidate: 0 or cache: 'no-store' is configured on individual fetch
// Requests made using fetch can specify a revalidate option
// to control the revalidation frequency of the request.
const res = await fetch("https://...", { next: { revalidate: 10 } });
```

```jsx
// React allows you to cache() and deduplicate requests,
// memoizing the result of the wrapped function call.
import { cache } from 'react'
export const getUser = cache(async (id) => {
  const user = await db.user.findUnique({ id })
  return user
})

export default async function UserLayout({ params: { id } }) {
  const user = await getUser(id)
  // ...
}
export default async function Page({ params: { id } }) {
  const user = await getUser(id)
  // ...
}
// Although the getUser() function is called twice in the
// example above, only one query will be made to the database.
```

```jsx
// POST requests and cache()
// POST requests are automatically deduplicated when using
// fetch â€“ unless they are inside of POST Route Handler or
// come after reading headers()/cookies()
```

```jsx
// Next.js allows you to update specific static routes
// without needing to rebuild your entire site.
// There are two types of revalidation in Next.js:
// Background: Revalidates the data at a specific time interval.
// On-demand: Revalidates the data based on an event such as an update.
// background revalidation
fetch("https://...", { next: { revalidate: 60 } });
// On-demand Revalidation
// The Next.js App Router supports revalidating content
// on-demand based on a route or cache tag.
// For example, the following fetch adds the cache tag collection:
export default async function Page() {
  const res = await fetch("https://...", { next: { tags: ["collection"] } });
  const data = await res.json();
  // ...
}
// This cached data can then be revalidated on-demand by
// calling revalidateTag in a Route Handler.
import { NextResponse } from "next/server";
import { revalidateTag } from "next/cache";

export async function GET(request) {
  const tag = request.nextUrl.searchParams.get("tag");
  revalidateTag(tag);
  return NextResponse.json({ revalidated: true, now: Date.now() });
}
```

```jsx
// If an error is thrown while attempting to revalidate
// data, the last successfully generated data will continue
// to be served from the cache. On the next subsequent request,
// Next.js will retry revalidating the data.
```

```jsx
// Previous Next.js data fetching methods such as getServerSideProps,
// getStaticProps, and getInitialProps are not supported in the
// new App Router
```
