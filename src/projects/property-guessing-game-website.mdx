##### Overview

I developed a [website](https://listed-clone.vercel.app/regions/all) inspired by listed.fun, where users engage in a game to guess the sale price of recently sold properties. This interactive website combines real estate knowledge with an entertaining guessing game.

##### Features:

- Multi-city gameplay across various American cities
- Progressive hint system: Users start with limited information, with more hints revealed as the number of guesses increases
- Feedback indicators showing how close the user's guess is to the actual price
- Diverse property hints, including: images of the property, ,umber of bedrooms and bathrooms, HOA status, etc.

##### Technical Details

**Frontend**: Next.js, Tailwindcss

**Backend**: Prisma ORM with PostgreSQL database (hosted on Supabase)

##### Key Learnings

- Efficient API usage: Carefully planning component structure and data flow helped minimize the number of calls to the Redfin API, leading to improved performance and reduced API costs.
- Thorough planning: Pre-coding website structure design saved time and reduced rework.
