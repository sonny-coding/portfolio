##### Project Overview

This Chrome extension aims to replicate the functionality of Google Dictionary (by Google), providing users with instant access to word definitions directly within their browser. By simply highlighting a word on any webpage, users can view its definition and hear its pronunciation.

You can find the project on [Github](https://github.com/sonny-coding/diction-extension). To use this extension:

- Download the project as a ZIP file from the GitHub repository.
- Unzip the file to a local directory.
- Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`.
- Enable "Developer mode" in the top right corner.
- Click "Load unpacked" and select the unzipped directory.
- Restart your Chrome browser and the extension should now be active.

##### Key Features

- **Instant Definition**s: Displays definitions for highlighted words in a non-intrusive popup.
- **Multiple Definitions**: Shows up to four definitions for comprehensive understanding.
- **Audio Pronunciation**: Offers audio playback of word pronunciation when available.
- **Smart Positioning**: Intelligently positions the popup to ensure visibility, adapting to screen edges and scroll position.

##### Technologies

- Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)
- RESTful API integration (Dictionary API)
- DOM manipulation, event handling and asynchronous programming (Fetch API)

This project is built entirely with vanilla JavaScript, which required me brushing up on core JavaScript concepts without relying on modern frameworks.

##### Development Challenges

Developing my first Chrome extension in vanilla JavaScript was an enjoyable challenge. The most significant technical hurdle was precisely positioning the definition popup next to highlighted text. I overcame this by implementing a dynamic positioning system, centering the popup above the selected word (or below if space is limited) and ensuring it stays within the viewport boundaries.

This Chrome extension is just the starting point. I welcome your feedback and suggestions for future enhancements. Share your thoughts on how to improve it by following me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/sonoverthinks). Happy coding!
