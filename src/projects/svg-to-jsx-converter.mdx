##### Overview

I've built a user-friendly web [tool](https://svg-react.vercel.app/) that simplifies working with SVGs in React projects. Users can easily:

- **Convert SVGs to JSX:** Input their raw SVG code and instantly transform it into JSX syntax ready to use in React components.
- **Save & Share SVGs:** Store their converted SVGs in a global library, allowing them and others to quickly access and reuse these assets.

This [tool](https://svg-react.vercel.app/) is a valuable time-saver for React developers, eliminating the manual conversion process and fostering a community-driven collection of SVG resources.

##### Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React, Tailwind CSS, React Router
- **Backend:** Express, MongoDB

##### Key Learnings & Skills

- **SVG Manipulation:** Programmatically parsing, validating, and manipulating SVG strings to generate valid JSX components.
- **Custom React Components:** Building reusable UI elements to efficiently display and interact with SVGs.

##### Future Enhancements

- **Expand Conversion Options:** Explore adding support for converting SVGs to other formats (e.g., React Native, image formats).
- **Customize JSX Output:** Provide settings for users to control the styling and formatting of their generated JSX.
- **Advanced SVG Editing:** Consider incorporating features for basic SVG editing directly within the tool.
