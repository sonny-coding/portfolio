##### Project Overview

I recently built a [stock finance project](https://stock-charts-ruddy.vercel.app/s/AAPL) using NextJS, TailwindCSS, Prisma, Supabase, Lucia, and the Alpha Vantage API. The goal of this project was to create a web application that allows users to visualize the fundamentals of publicly traded stocks through interactive and customizable charts, while also providing a secure and personalized experience through authentication.

##### Features

The application offers the following features:

- **Stock Lookup**: Users can search for any publicly traded stock by its ticker symbol to view a variety of financial charts, including revenue, margins, earnings, cash flows, and more.
- **Chart Visualization**: The application uses beautiful and interactive charts to display financial data, allowing users to easily analyze trends and patterns.
- **Table Format**: In addition to charts, users can also view financial data in a table format for a more detailed analysis.
- **Screenshot Capability**: Users can take screenshots of the charts for future reference or sharing.
- **Favorites List**: Users can save their favorite stock tickers to a list for easy access and future analysis.
- **Authentication**: Users can create an account and log in to access their personalized favorites list and other features.

##### Technical Details

The application was built using the following technologies:

- **NextJS**: A popular React framework for building server-side rendered and statically generated websites.
- **TailwindCSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for building custom user interfaces.
- **Prisma**: A powerful ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool for interacting with databases.
- **Supabase**: A PostgreSQL-based database platform for storing and managing data
- **Lucia**: A secure and scalable authentication library for NextJS.
- **Alpha Vantage API**: A financial data API for retrieving historical and real-time stock data.

##### Key Learnings

Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with:

- **Data manipulation**: I learned how to manipulate financial data to display on graphs, including handling missing values, formatting dates, and calculating moving averages.
- **Charting libraries**: I gained experience with **Recharts**, a popular charting library, and **Shadcn Charts**, a popular component library built on top of Recharts, and learned how to customize charts to fit the application's needs.
- **Authentication**: I learned how to implement secure authentication using Lucia. I also learned how to handle cookies and sessions.
- **API integration**: I gained experience with integrating third-party APIs, including the Alpha Vantage API, and learned how to handle API errors and rate limiting.
- **Database management**: I learned how to design and manage a database using Prisma and Supabase, including creating a schema and performing queries.

##### Benefits

The application provides users with a user-friendly and intuitive interface for analyzing stock fundamentals, making it easier to make informed investment decisions. The ability to save favorite stock tickers, and take screenshots of charts, and access personalized features adds to the application's convenience and functionality.
