Hi, I'm Son, a software engineer based in Phoenix, Arizona. I love creating websites that look great and work even better.

You'll usually find me:

- **Designing & Coding**: Building beautiful, functional websites.
- **Learning**: Always improving my skills in this ever-changing field.

When I'm not working, I enjoy playing soccer, guitar, and spending time with my fianc√©e.
