Startups and small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) are continually turning to the cloud to enhance the agility, scalability, and cost-effectiveness of their business–57% reported increased reliance on the cloud in 2022, according to DigitalOcean’s Currents report. However, one concern for many businesses is data disruption due to accidental deletion, tech stack changes, or service disruptions. Losing data can cause revenue loss, reputational damage, and poor customer experience, which are especially harmful to small, growing businesses.

To better enable startups and SMBs to protect their cloud data across files, apps, and databases, we’re excited to announce DigitalOcean’s acquisition of SnapShooter, a backup and recovery solutions provider. SnapShooter makes cloud backups simple, fast and flexible, offering one system to consolidate all backups so you can be confident in knowing your cloud data is protected.

Here’s what SnapShooter customer Siebird, a web design and digital marketing agency, has to say about their experience:

“Siebird has trusted SnapShooter to back up and protect our client websites for over 2.5 years. We host all our client websites on DigitalOcean. From the beginning, SnapShooter stood out from the rest with how effortless it has made configuring backups. We always dreaded setting up new backup jobs–now we don’t. We have peace of mind knowing our client websites are protected and can be restored with a click of a button.”

#### What I learned

- Create an image carousel with swiper

```jsx
import Codeblock from "./Codeblock";

const components = {};

components.pre = (props) => <Codeblock {...props} />;

export default components;
```

- Get email and slack alerts of backups

```jsx
export const getStaticProps = async () => {
  // connect to db
  await connectDB();

  // get all the file names
  const fileNames = getFileNames();
  // read each file, update reading time, text, and append the content to the gray matter data
  const allParsedData = fileNames.map((fileName) => {
    const slug = fileName.replace(".mdx", "");
    const parsedFile = readBlogFiles(fileName);
    // console.log(parsedFile);
    const { data, content } = matter(parsedFile);
    data.readingTime = readingTime(content).text;
    data.slug = slug;
    data.content = content;
    return data;
  });

  const blogBulkUpdateArray = allParsedData.map((blog) => ({
    updateOne: {
      filter: { customID: blog.customID },
      update: {
        $set: blog,
      },
      upsert: true,
      setDefaultOnInsert: true,
    },
  }));
  await Blog.bulkWrite(blogBulkUpdateArray);

  const project = {
    _id: 0,
    _v: 0,
    content: 0,
  };

  // get the top blogs and most recent blogs
  const limit = 1;
  const topBlogsResult = await Blog.find({}, project)
    .sort("-totalViews")
    .limit(limit);
  const recentBlogsResult = await Blog.find({}, project)
    .sort("-createdAt")
    .limit(limit);

  // convert mongoose objects to normal objects
  const topBlogs = topBlogsResult.map((blog) => {
    const blogObject = blog.toObject();
    blogObject.createdAt = blogObject.createdAt.toDateString();
    return blogObject;
  });
  const recentBlogs = recentBlogsResult.map((blog) => {
    const blogObject = blog.toObject();
    blogObject.createdAt = blogObject.createdAt.toDateString();
    return blogObject;
  });

  return {
    props: { topBlogs, recentBlogs },
  };
};
```
