Building this blog has been quite the journey â€“ definitely my most time-consuming project to date! I know there will come a day when I revisit the source code and wonder how I managed to pull it all off. While my memory is still fresh, I'll take this opportunity to document my thought process and answer the questions I imagine future-me will have.

##### When a new blog post is written, how does it get added to the database?

New blog posts are saved as MDX within the "blogs" folder. During the build process, `getStaticProps` iterates through these files to identify new content. It then adds new posts and updates existing ones, if necessary, to the MongoDB database using `bulkWrite`.

##### How does bulkwrite work?

Bulk write operations in MongoDB allow you to perform multiple write operations (inserts, updates, deletes) on a collection in a single request, improving efficiency compared to sending individual requests. In my implementation, I loop through the files in the "blogs" folder to create an array of operations, where each operation corresponds to a post. Then, I call `bulkWrite` on this array, and it handles the rest.

##### How do I "loop" through the files?

I use `fs.readdirSync` to get a list of filenames from the 'blog' directory. Then, I can read the content of each file using `fs.readFileSync`.

##### How can I include information like reading time, date created, and writer in each blog post?

This sort of information is called "metadata" and is typically written in JSON format at the beginning of the file. I include some of the metadata directly in the MDX file, like title and tags. Other information, such as reading time, is added later during build time within the `getStaticProps` function.

##### How to read metadata in the MDX files?

MDX files store metadata at the beginning in a section called "front matter." I use the gray-matter library to read and parse this front matter. The gray-matter library would take the following code block:

```
---
title: My First Blog
slug: my-first-blog
---
<h1>Hello world!</h1>
```

and return this object:

```js
{
  content: '<h1>Hello world!</h1>',
  data: {
    title: 'My First Blog',
    slug: 'my-first-blog'
  }
}
```

##### Now that my blog posts are saved, how do I display each one as a dedicated page on the website?

To render blog posts, I leverage Next.js dynamic segments (`[slug]`) along with `getStaticPaths` and `getStaticProps`. This combo fetches slugs and their corresponding posts from MongoDB, then formats the content with `MDXRemote`.

##### How does `mdxRemote` work?

To display MDX content in React, `MDXRemote` uses its `serialize` function to convert raw MDX into a React-friendly format. This serialized content is then passed to the `MDXRemote` component along with an object that provides styling for the HTML elements, since `MDXRemote` doesn't handle styling by default. The styling object itself contains key-value structures, where each key is an HTML element and the corresponding value is a component styled with Tailwind CSS.

##### How to implement the search function?

I leverage MongoDB Atlas to build autocomplete search functionality. This involves defining a search index that specifies the 'title' field for autocomplete functionality. With this setup, I can utilize the autocomplete operator within my queries to generate suggestions based on the user's input as they type.

##### Is there anything else I should know?

"Initially, I put all trivia in a single file. During the build process, `getStaticProp` would iterate through this file and populate the database with all the entries. However, manually adding trivia became tedious. To streamline this process, I built a CLI tool using `npx`. This tool allows me to directly add trivia entries to the database, making it much faster. Now, whenever I stumble upon interesting trivia while browsing, I can quickly add it to my blog with a simple command.

I learned how to build the CLI tool by reading Shahed Nasser's [blog](https://blog.shahednasser.com/how-to-create-a-npx-tool/). Additionally, I want to credit to thatanjan on GitHub and Youtube, who built an comprehensive blog in this [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMGdsjmw0q8&list=PLEr-WXao6eSPBeUOaaHnQ1qG22_J5hM1o) using Next.js and ChakraUI, from which I drew a lot of ideas.
